# DOTNet Core API MongoDB
This project was intially created as a simple Web API for temporary storage (caching) of CAD files as Blobs (Binary Large Objects) in a MongoDB Atlas cloud Database. I was curious to see if there was a benefit over a traditional FTP + RDBMS (for storing filepaths) setup in the following areas:
* Quicker to retrieve files than FTP + RDBMS
* Easier to setup, backup and scale 
* Easier revision management
