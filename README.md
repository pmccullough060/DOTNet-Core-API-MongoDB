# DOTNet Core API MongoDB
This project was intially created as a simple Web API for temporary storage (caching) of CAD files as Blobs (binary Large Objects) in a MongoDB Atlas cloud Database. I was curious to see if there was a benefit over a traditional FTP process in the following areas:
* Quicker to retrieve files than FTP
* Easier to setup, backup and scale
* Easier revision management
